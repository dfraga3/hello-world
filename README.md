Learning the GitHub process

I am working on this project to strengthen my understanding and experience with GitHub and then eventually the Laravel framework.
I hope to redesign Fraga Studios site in Laravel/PHP and move to a different host provider - possiblly even AWS.  There are many new technologies and processes that I would like to gain more experience with.
